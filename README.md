# Platformatic Runtime API

This is a generated [Platformatic Runtime](https://docs.platformatic.dev/docs/reference/runtime/introduction) application.

## Building a monolith

I followed this [guide](https://docs.platformatic.dev/docs/guides/build-modular-monolith) in order to build this toy-monolith. And yeii i contributed by fixing how to use the client in the docs!

## Deploy

Deploy was done through CLI since actions doesn't work properly.

``npx platformatic deploy --keys production.plt.txt``
